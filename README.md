# Attention & Intentional Binding

This study aims to look at the role of attention on the propective & retrospective sense of agency by using the intentional binding paradigm.\

Attention is found to be an important factor on agency. Yet, it is not clear at which part of the process it has a role; propective, retrospective or both. Thus, seperately prospectively constructed and retrospectively constructed soa is compared in 2 cognitive load (low vs high).

Many studies found that the percieved time of intentional actions are shifted forward whereas percieved time of the outcome shifted backward which is called the intentionl binding.\
In this study, the method that was used in the study of Haggard & Moore (2008) is used to dissociate the prospective and retrospective agency.\
Participants are asked to make a key press which produces a tone with a certain probability.\
In a block 75% and in another block only 25% of the actions produce the tone. \
The strength of the intentional binding in actions producing tone in 75% block and 25% block is compared. \
Since both actions produce an outcome, only difference is their predictive cues.
On the other hand, the actions in the same block which produces an outcome and do not produce any outcome is compared.\
Since the actions are in the same probability block their predictive cues are the same but the only difference is having an outcome or not.\
Therefore, only difference is their retrospective cues.\



###For what purposes the code can be used:

- Intentional Binding Paradigm (a rotating clock with one revolution every 2560ms, an auditory outcome, marking the time by clicking on the clock (the clockhand rotates through the clicked position))
- Showing a number on the screen 
- Showing the typed numbers on the screen back

The template of the code is an automatic translation of Python code created by PsychoPy builder to JS. 
Modifications on the template are done by me.
