# Attention & Intentional Binding

This study aims to look at the role of attention on the propective & retrospective sense of agency by using the intentional binding paradigm.

For what purposes the code can be used:

- Intentional Binding Paradigm (a rotating clock, an auditory outcome, marking the time by clicking on the clock (the clockhand rotates through the clicked position))
- Showing a number on the screen 
- Showing the typed numbers on the screen back

The template of the code is an automatic translation of Python code created by PsychoPy builder to JS. 
Modifications on the template are done by me.
